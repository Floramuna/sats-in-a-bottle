## 1. Product Overview

**Sats in a Bottle** is a Bitcoin-powered gifting and time-locking application that combines a personal message with Bitcoin, sealing both around a future unlock condition. A sender creates a digital bottle, attaches a message and sats, selects an unlock condition, and shares the sealed bottle with a recipient.

**Product promise:** *"Money with a message, locked until it matters."*

### Pillars

| Pillar | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Message | Text, voice or photo carrying the human story. |
| Bitcoin | Real value, denominated in sats and controlled by the intended owner. |
| Future condition | A supported date/rule determining when the bottle can open. |

### Primary Use Cases

- Birthday and graduation gifts
- Anniversaries and milestones
- Parents saving for a child's future
- Migrant families sending future-oriented gifts
- Inheritance and legacy messages
- Long-term savings with a deliberate access barrier

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Digital gifting normally separates emotional communication from financial value. A card, letter or voice note can carry meaning but not financial value; a bank transfer can move value but usually lacks the experience of a sealed future message.

| Current approach | Strength | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| Card / letter | Emotional | Usually no financial value or enforced future access |
| Voice message | Personal | No attached financial value |
| Bank transfer | Real money | Generally immediate and emotionally cold |
| Traditional savings / trust | Long-term purpose | Can be complex and intermediary-dependent |

---

## 3. Solution

The application packages a message and Bitcoin into one digital bottle. The message is encrypted, while the Bitcoin is governed by a Bitcoin timelock. The application presents the bottle, tracks blockchain state, and guides the recipient through the reveal and claim experience.

### Core Principles

- Self-custody by default
- Bitcoin-native timelock enforcement
- Client-side encryption where practical
- Sats-first UX
- Transparent transaction and fee states
- Simple language for Bitcoin beginners

---

## 4. How It Works

1. **Create Bottle** — choose recipient, title, message type and unlock condition.
2. **Add Message** — write text or record/upload a voice note; encrypt content.
3. **Add Sats** — select the Bitcoin amount and fund through the supported wallet flow.
4. **Set Unlock Date** — choose a supported date/time condition.
5. **Seal** — create and fund the Bitcoin timelock transaction/output.
6. **Share** — generate an unguessable link and optional QR code.
7. **Wait** — display countdown, confirmation state and reminders.
8. **Unlock** — once the Bitcoin condition is satisfied, enable the reveal/claim experience.
9. **Claim & Reveal** — reveal the message and guide the recipient through the Bitcoin spend/claim flow.

---

## 5. MVP Scope

| MVP Must Have | Future |
|---|---|
| Create bottle | Multi-recipient inheritance |
| Text message | Video notes |
| Voice note | Goal/community bottles |
| Amount in sats | Recurring bottles |
| Fixed-date timelock | Complex event triggers |
| Sealed link + QR | M-Pesa cash-out |
| Countdown/status | Stablecoin support |
| Recipient reveal + claim | Advanced re-bottling graph |

---

## 6. Bitcoin Technical Foundation

The financial primitive is a **Bitcoin timelock**. For an absolute time-based unlock, `CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` (CLTV) can enforce that spending a particular output is not valid before the specified locktime, provided the script and spending transaction are constructed correctly.

> **Important:** the frontend must never imply that the app itself can simply "unlock Bitcoin." Bitcoin consensus rules enforce the spend condition. The application tracks state, stores encrypted metadata, presents the bottle, and guides wallet interactions.

### Bottle States

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Draft | Configured but not funded/sealed. |
| Awaiting funding | Waiting for the required Bitcoin transaction. |
| Funded | Funding transaction detected. |
| Sealed / Timelocked | Relevant output is protected by the timelock. |
| Unlockable | Timelock condition has been reached. |
| Claimed | Recipient completed the supported spend/claim flow. |
| Cancelled / recovery | Only if an explicitly designed recovery path exists; funds must never be silently lost. |

> **Development environment:** use Bitcoin Regtest or Signet for transaction and timelock testing before considering mainnet.

---

## 7. System Architecture

| Layer | Technology | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Web | React + Tailwind | UI, flows, dashboard, recipient experience |
| Mobile | React Native | Mobile-first bottle creation and recipient experience |
| Backend | Node.js or FastAPI | Orchestration, auth, metadata, reminders, blockchain status |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Bottle/user/status/transaction metadata |
| Storage | S3-compatible encrypted storage | Encrypted voice/image/message objects |
| Bitcoin | Bitcoin Core | Chain data and transaction verification |
| Wallet | Supported Bitcoin wallet integrations | User-controlled signing |
| Testing | Jest / Pytest + Regtest/Signet | Automated validation |

**High-level flow:** Frontend ↔ API ↔ PostgreSQL/encrypted storage · Frontend ↔ Wallet ↔ Bitcoin network · Backend ↔ Bitcoin Core/indexer → bottle status · Backend → notifications.

---

## 8. Core Data Model

| Entity | Key fields |
|---|---|
| User | id, display_name, identifier, wallet reference, created_at |
| Bottle | id, owner_id, recipient reference, title, status, unlock_at, created_at |
| Message | id, bottle_id, type, encrypted object reference, encryption metadata |
| BitcoinLock | id, bottle_id, network, txid, vout, amount_sats, locktime, script reference |
| RecipientAccess | id, bottle_id, access-token reference, redeemed_at |
| Event | id, bottle_id, event_type, timestamp, metadata |
| Notification | id, bottle_id, type, scheduled_at, sent_at |

---

## 9. Frontend Specification

### Primary Screens

- **Landing** — Product story: message + sats + future condition.
- **Create Bottle** — Guided multi-step flow with progress and autosave.
- **Message Composer** — Text editor, voice recorder and optional image.
- **Bitcoin Amount** — Sats entry, BTC equivalent and network fee disclosure.
- **Unlock Condition** — Date/time picker with plain-language timelock explanation.
- **Review & Seal** — Recipient, message, amount, fee, date and wallet confirmation.
- **Sealed Bottle** — Bottle visual, countdown, blockchain status and sharing.
- **Recipient Bottle** — Sealed state with no message preview before unlock.

## 10. UI/UX Direction

The interface should feel warm, trustworthy and memorable rather than like a trading terminal. Baby purple carries the emotional brand identity; gold marks Bitcoin/value moments; white provides clarity and breathing room.

| Element | Direction |
|---|---|
| Primary | Baby purple / soft lavender |
| Bitcoin accent | Warm gold |
| Background | White + very light lavender surfaces |
| Text | Deep purple / charcoal |
| Cards | Rounded, subtle borders and shadows |
| Buttons | One dominant action per step |
| Typography | Friendly modern sans-serif with strong hierarchy |
| Illustration | Digital glass bottle / sealed capsule motif |
| Motion | Subtle seal, shimmer and countdown transitions |

### UX Principles

- Progressive disclosure
- Plain-language Bitcoin explanations
- Always show what is happening to the money
- Clear confirmation before signing/funding
- Accessible labels, contrast and captions/transcripts
- Responsive mobile-first design
- Trust signals: network, confirmations and relevant transaction identifiers

---

## 11. Visual Design Tokens

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Purple 50 | `#F3EEFB` | Backgrounds |
| Baby Purple | `#B79AE8` | Brand accents |
| Deep Purple | `#5B3A91` | Headings / primary UI |
| Bitcoin Gold | `#D4AF37` | Sats and Bitcoin highlights |
| White | `#FFFFFF` | Cards / main canvas |
| Charcoal | `#292333` | Primary text |
| Muted | `#66606F` | Secondary text |

> These are initial tokens. Validate contrast/accessibility and refine during the design stage.

---

## 12. Security & Trust Model

- Encrypt message content before backend storage where practical.
- Keep signing keys in the user's wallet for the self-custodial MVP.
- Use high-entropy bottle identifiers; never expose sensitive message content in URLs.
- Separate authorization for bottle metadata, encrypted blobs and recipient access.
- Use secure authentication and optional 2FA.
- Verify Bitcoin transaction state from blockchain data, not only client claims.
- Display network fees separately from the gift amount.
- Document recovery/spend paths before real funds are used.
- Never claim funds are recoverable unless the actual recovery path has been implemented and tested.

> **Security rule:** a beautiful UI must never hide a dangerous financial assumption.

---

## 13. Error & Edge Cases

- Wallet not connected
- Insufficient balance
- Fee changes before signing
- Funding transaction not detected
- Insufficient confirmations
- Invalid/expired bottle link
- Recipient lacks a compatible wallet
- Unlock time not reached
- Claim transaction fails
- Encrypted message cannot be decrypted
- User closes app during funding/sealing
- Backend unavailable while Bitcoin funds remain independently controlled

> Every financial error should explain what happened, whether the user's funds are safe, and what action is available next.

---

## 14. Testing Strategy

| Test | Coverage |
|---|---|
| Unit | Sats arithmetic, locktime/date conversion, validation, state transitions |
| Component | Forms, countdown, recorder states, loading/errors, responsive UI |
| API | Auth, bottle CRUD, authorization, encrypted references |
| Bitcoin integration | Script construction, transaction validity, locktime enforcement, confirmations |
| E2E | Create → fund → seal → share → unlock → reveal → claim |
| Security | Authorization, token entropy, encryption, malformed input |
| Usability | Bitcoin beginner completes flow without specialist knowledge |

> **Critical:** timelock logic must be tested against actual Bitcoin node behavior, not only mocked responses.

---

## 15. Acceptance Criteria

- A beginner can create a bottle without knowing Bitcoin scripting terminology.
- Text and/or voice message can be attached.
- Amount can be entered in sats with BTC equivalent shown.
- Supported unlock date/time can be selected.
- Draft, funding, sealed, unlockable and claimed states are distinct.
- Sealed bottle does not expose message content before unlock.
- Share link and QR can be generated.
- Backend verifies relevant Bitcoin transaction state.
- Self-custodial MVP does not require application-controlled private keys.
- Core flows pass automated Regtest/Signet tests.

---

## 16. Future Features

- **Re-Bottle** — recipient adds a new message and sats and passes a new bottle state forward.
- **Goal Bottles** — community funding or savings goals.
- **Community Bottles** — multiple contributors.
- **Recurring Bottles** — scheduled contributions.
- Multi-recipient inheritance bottles.
- Video notes.
- Stablecoin support.
- M-Pesa/mobile-money cash-out integrations.

> Re-Bottle should create a new auditable financial/message state rather than silently editing the original bottle.
